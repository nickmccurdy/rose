# Rose
An interactive, technical, and openly editable [Rosetta
Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) for developers.

Think of it as an interactive Rosetta Stone table, or a technical thesaurus for
looking up features across different technologies. Rose makes it easy to learn
how to do things you're used to with new technologies.
